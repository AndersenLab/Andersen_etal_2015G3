# RIAILs 1 Pruning

Load up dplyr for pruning and read in the data.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data <- read.csv("Data/ProcessedPhenotypes.csv")
```

Filter out every well where n is not between 5 and 1000 so that variance values are accurate and biologically impossible populations are not mapped. Also filter out any wells where the normalized n is greater than 350.

```{r}
data1 <- filter(data, n > 5, n < 1000, norm.n < 350)
```

Prune out all yellow traits, as there are many NAs and 0s

```{r}
data2 <- select(data1, -contains("yellow"))
```

Save the final data frame for mapping

```{r}
write.csv(data2, file="Data/MappingPhenotypes.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
